<p<a name="week2" class="anchor" href="#week2"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>>Week 2 Goals</p>

<p>Model
  <ul>
  <li>Will work on Stage 1 base mortality model</li>
  <li>Will hopefully be able to add State 2 "sickness" and risk factor variables</li>
  </ul></p>

<p>Dissemination and translation
  <ul>
    <li>Work with AH</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Will create list of possible training session on modeling and other data visualization techniques and work to develop first session</li>
    <li>Will follow-up with disparities and HIT interest groups</li>
   <li>Will attend AH Translation and Dissemination Institute mini-retreat</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Webinar: Will identify potential speakers</li>
    <li>Website (<a href="http://emoyusa.github.io">emoyusa.github.io</a>): Will continue to update weekly</li>
    </ul></p>

<p<span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>Week 2 Progress</p>

<p>Model
  <ul>
  <li>Completed <a href="https://vimeo.com/101240022">new base model</a> that incorporates
 <ul>
 <li>Real annual mortality rates based on 2008 NCHS life tables</li>
 <li>Estimated annual rates of developing 3 risk factors -- smoking, obesity, and sedentary lifestyle -- based on prevalence by age in 2010 BRFSS</li>
 <li>Estimated effects of smoking, obesity, and sedentary lifestyle on morality based on literature</li>
 <li>Estimated effects of proximity to supermarkets and parks on development of obesity based on literature</li>
<li>Estimated effects of proximity to fitness centers and parks on development of sedentary lifestyle based on literature</li>
<li>Estimated effects of health care on mortality and development of risk factors based on literature</li>
<li>Real parameters: 1 tick = 1 year; 1 map square = 1/10 mile x 1/10 mile; 1 person icon = 100 DC residents</li>
<li>Real environment: Counts of supermarkets, fitness centers, and doctor's offices in DC; acreage of parks in DC with at least 300 acres</li>
 </ul>
 </li>
  <li>Next steps: Calibration and then addition of West vs. East DC and disparities</li>
  </ul></p>

<p>Dissemination and translation
  <ul>
    <li>Work with AH</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Working on possible training session on modeling or other data visualization techniques</li>
    <li>Working with disparities interest group; need to contact HIT interest group</li>
   <li>Attended AH Translation and Dissemination Institute mini-retreat</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Webinar on system science simulation is growing own legs as it is appreciated that modeling is being used in public health systems and PCORI pilots; will continue to help with planning</li>
    <li>Website updated</li>
    </ul></p>

<p>Bonus: Lunched with Lok, ex-QRDR and PSO team member</p>
