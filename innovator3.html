  <li>Finish up final "real" disparities model</li>
  <li>Start thinking about "educational" model</li>
  </ul></p>


<p>Dissemination and translation
  <ul>
    <li>Work with AH</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Hone in on content of possible training session on modeling or other data visualization techniques</li>
    <li>Arrange to meet with disparities interest group and reach out to HIT interest group</li>
       </ul>
    <li>Webinar: Support as needed</li>
    <li>Website (<a href="http://emoyusa.github.io">emoyusa.github.io</a>): Will continue to update weekly</li>

<p><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>>Week 3 Progress</p>


<p>Model
  <ul>
  <li><a href = "https://vimeo.com/101983149">"Real" disparities model version 2.1</a></li>
  <ul>
  <li>"Calibrated" model to keep populations stable but appreciate that data on prevalence by age provides insight into net changes but not magnitude of inflows and outflows; have set outflows to be constant and set probability of  starting to exercise equal to probability of ceasing to be obese</li>
  <li>Added line to separate east and west, two races, a Disparities Effect variable that gives greater health care benefit to pinks vs. browns, and trackers for different counts and rates</li>
  <li>Added sliders to allow users to adjust model parameters at setup or as model is run</li>
  </ul>
  <li><a href ="https://vimeo.com/101985669">"Educational" model</a></li>
  <ul>
  <li>Added background graphic</li>
  <Added score based keeping premature mortality low and both geographic and racial disparities low</li>
  <li>Added 5 levels of increasing difficulty</li>
   <li>Developed gaming user interface with increasing user actions as levels progress</li>
   <li>Added ability to keep track of a high score and take snapshot if new high score is attained</li>
  </ul>
  </ul></p>


<p>Dissemination and translation
  <ul>
    <li>Work with AH</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Plan to demo new models for Academy Health this week</li>
    <li>Still working to hone in on content of possible training session on modeling or other data visualization techniques</li>
    <li>Plan to meet with disparities interest group next week and reach out to HIT interest group</li>
       </ul>
    <li>Webinar: Support as needed</li>
    <li>Website (<a href="http://emoyusa.github.io">emoyusa.github.io</a>): Will continue to update weekly</li>
    </ul></p>
